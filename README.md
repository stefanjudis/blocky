# Blocky

**Wanna read something and don't want to be interrupted?**

**Have got a terminal session open and just want to watch it?**

This is an example project to show how to use the `Tray` module and prevent your machine to go into screensaver or sleep mode.

Blocky will put itself inside of your menu bar and give you an easy way to not interupt you by going into sleep or screensave mode.
